# Filtering

You can filter collection items by adding a `filter` key to the collectionâ€™s array in `config.php`, and specifying a
callable that accepts the collection item and returns a boolean. Items that return `false` from the filter will not be
built.

A common use for filtering is to mark some blog posts as `published`, using a variable in the YAML front matter of each
collection item that specifies a boolean or a date. Using a filter in `config.production.php`, draft posts can be made
visible in the local or staging environments, but omitted from your production build.

> Note that by default, variables from environment-specific config files are not merged recursively; only the top-level
> keys are considered for merging. For collections, you can override this behavior by setting `merge_collection_configs`
> to
> true in your main `config.php` file. This will allow you to only specify the environment-specific changes to your
`collections` settings.

> config.php

```php 
<?php

return [
    'merge_collection_configs' => true,
    'collections' => [
        'posts' => [
            'filter' => function ($item) {
                return $item->published;
            },
            // other settings for this collection...
        ],
        // other collections...
    ],
];
```

> config.production.php

```php 
<?php

return [
    'collections' => [
        'posts' => [
            'filter' => function ($item) {
                return $item;
            }
        ],
    ],
];
```
