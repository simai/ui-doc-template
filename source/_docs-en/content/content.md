# Creating Your Site’s Content
All content for your site should be stored in the `source` directory. When authoring your content, you have the choice to create files using several formats, including:


!links
- [Laravel’s Blade templating language](content-blade/)
- [Markdown](content-markdown/)
- [Or a variety of other file types](content-other-file-types/)
!endlinks
