# Compiling Assets

Jigsaw sites are configured with support for Vite out of the box. If you’ve ever used Vite in a Laravel project, you
already know how to use Vite with Jigsaw.

## Setup

To get started, first make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed. Then, pull in the dependencies needed to compile
your assets:

npm install
For more detailed installation instructions, check out the full Laravel Vite documentation.

## Vite config

On the root of your project, you’ll find Vite’s config file with Jigsaw’s plugin configured:

`input` sets two entry points, `main.js` for JavaScript and `main.css` for CSS.

refresh indicates wether or not to listen for changes.

```js
import jigsaw from '@tighten/jigsaw-vite-plugin';
import {defineConfig} from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        jigsaw({
            input: [
                'source/_core/_assets/js/main.js',
                'source/_core/_assets/css/main.css'
            ],
            refresh: true,
        }),
    ],
});
```

## Referencing Assets

In your main layout file, your assets are referenced using the vite method. The @viteRefresh() directive is needed for
enabling automatic page refreshes when you make changes during local development.

```html
@viteRefresh()
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ vite('source/_core/_assets/css/main.css') }}">
<script defer type="module" src="{{ vite('source/_core/_assets/js/main.js') }}"></script>
```

## Importing Modules

From these entry points, you can easily import additional modules. Vite handles serving these modules when you preview
your site with npm run dev, and it efficiently bundles them when you prepare for production with npm run build.

In JavaScript, you can import libraries and other local files:

```js
import {get} from 'lodash';
import helpers from './helpers';
```

Similarly, in CSS, you can import other style files, whether they’re from packages or local to your project:

```js
@import 'prismjs/themes/prism.css';

@import './more-styles.css';
```

## Sass and Less

Vite offers built-in support for pre-processor files like .scss, .sass, .less, .styl, and .stylus. You don’t need to
install any Vite-specific plugins for them. However, you need to install the corresponding pre-processor package itself:

```
# For .scss and .sass files
npm add -D sass-embedded # or sass

# For .less files
npm add -D less

# For .styl and .stylus files
npm add -D stylus
```

Once installed, you can then import these types of files directly into your main CSS file (e.g., `main.css`):

```css
@import './my-styles.sass';
```

## Changing asset locations

We recommend to keep these entry points in `/source/_core/_assets`. The default structure looks like this:

<div class="files">
    <div class="folder folder--open">source
 <div class="folder folder--open focus">_core
        <div class="folder folder--open">_assets
            <div class="folder folder--open">js
                <div class="file">main.js</div>
            </div>
            <div class="folder folder--open">css
                <div class="file">main.css</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="folder folder--open">_layouts
            <div class="file">master.blade.php</div>
        </div>
</div>
        <div class="folder folder--open">assets
            <div class="folder folder--open">images
                <div class="file">jigsaw.png</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="file">index.blade.php</div>
    </div>
    <div class="folder">vendor</div>
    <div class="ellipsis">...</div>
</div>

However, you’re free to store your assets elsewhere and update your Vite configuration and layout accordingly. For
instance, if you choose to store them in a directory named `foobar` at the root of your project, you’d update your Blade
layout like this:
```html
@viteRefresh()
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ vite('foobar/css/main.css') }}">
<script defer type="module" src="{{ vite('foobar/js/main.js') }}"></script>
```
And your `jigsaw` configuration in `vite.config.js` would look like this:
```js
jigsaw({
input: ['foobar/js/main.js', 'foobar/css/main.css'],
refresh: true,
}),
```
Keep in mind that if you place this directory under `source`, its name **must** start with an underscore (e.g., `_foobar`) to
prevent Jigsaw from directly copying its contents to the build output.
