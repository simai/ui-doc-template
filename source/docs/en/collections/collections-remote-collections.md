# Remote Collections

In addition to using Markdown or Blade files for your collection items, you can return collection items directly from
the `collections` array in `config.php`. This allows you to generate items programmatically—for example, you can fetch
items from a remote source such as an external API or API-based content management systems like Contentful, GraphCMS, or
DatoCMS.

## Building collection items in config.php

For any collection, items can be built by returning an array or collection of `items` from the collection’s configuration
array in `config.php`. Each item should be an array; the keys of the item will be converted to page variables (such as
those that would typically appear in the YAML header of a Markdown file), while the value of the `content` key will serve
as the content of the collection item. This content will be parsed as Markdown, and thus can contain either Markdown or
HTML content; it will be available within your Blade templates with `@yield('content')` or by echoing `{!! $page->
getContent() !!}`:

> config.php
```php 
return [
'collections' => [
'posts' => [
'extends' => '_layouts.post',
'items' => [
[
'title' => 'Title of my first post',
'content' => '## The first post content',
],
[
'title' => 'Title of my second post',
'content' => '## The second post content',
],
],
],
],
];
```
> _layouts/post.blade.php
```blade 
@extends('_layouts.master')

@section('body')
<h1>{{ $page->title }}</h1>

    @yield('content')

@endsection
```

Under the hood, Jigsaw will:

1. Create a `_tmp` directory in the collection’s directory (e.g. `source/_posts/_tmp`) to store temporary Markdown files for
each remote collection item
2. Process the temporary files as though they were `*.blade.md` files
3. Remove the temporary files when `jigsaw build` is complete

In addition to `content`, each item can specify a `filename` key, which will be used as the name of the temporary Markdown
file. If omitted, the filename will default to the name of the collection followed by an index, so `post-1.blade.md`,
`post-2.blade.md`, etc. The resulting `path` of the output file will be processed according to the normal rules for
collections.

Alternatively, the `items` array can contain simple string values, which will be treated as the item’s Markdown content,
with no page variables:

> config.php
```php 
return [
'collections' => [
'posts' => [
'extends' => '_layouts.post',
'items' => [
'## The content for post 1',
'## The content for post 2',
'## The content for post 3',
],
],
],
];
```
---

## Fetching collection items from a remote API
The `items` key in `config.php` can also reference a closure that returns an array or collection of items. By using a
closure, collection items can be fetched from anywhere—from a remote API, from other places on the filesystem, or built
up programmatically. The resulting data can then be transformed before collection items are built. For example:

> config.php
```php 
return [
'collections' => [
'posts' => [
'extends' => '_layouts.post',
'items' => function ($config) {
$posts = json_decode(file_get_contents('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'));

                return collect($posts)->map(function ($post) {
                    return [
                        'title' => $post->title,
                        'content' => $post->body,
                    ];
                });
            },
        ],
    ],

];
```

If you want the remote API to only be called when building for particular environments, you can place the `items` closure
in the appropriate `config.{environment}.php` file. For example, to only access your remote API when running `build
production`, create a config.production.php file and include your `items` closure there. This will prevent potentially long
build times while running `build local` in development.

The `items` closure receives the `config` array as a parameter, so you may also reference other config values (for example,
an API URL) inside the closure.
